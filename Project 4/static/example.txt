Chatbots are common on so many business websites because they are autonomous and the data they store can be used for improving customer service, managing customer complaints, improving efficiencies, product research and so much more. They can also be used for providing personalized product recommendations, offering discounts, helping with refunds and return procedures, and many other tasks. Chatbots do all this by recognizing the intent of a user’s query and then presenting the most appropriate response. They use high-accuracy algorithms that are powered by NLP and semantics.

A major benefit of chatbots is that they can provide this service to consumers at all times of the day. More importantly, relevant and personalized content. And in today’s market personalization is the key to success. All this data that is gathered over time is analyzed by NLP algorithms and extracted for emotion mining - all the insights of which can be seen on a sentiment visualization dashboard for an in-depth view of customer sentiment about the brand and product.
